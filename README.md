KidErra by SheHacks is a system designed to monitor and protect the children from stressful/inappropriate content and/or situations.

# KidErra Project
This project is a 34 hours work for the CSE infamous hackathon HACK !T in its 3rd edition 2022.  [Link to the event's website](https://cse-hackit-2k22.cse.club/?fbclid=IwAR3mTsmTSrF91ot9eii6jG55SYlqSoPK5IoJvoXt3-ZRPgeSyOfutvy8nYo).

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to monitor and watch over kids as they develop curiosity for new content and experiences. 
We keep track of the child's health state and stress levels (heart rate, blood pressure) and detect whenever a parent (or our lockscreenservice) needs to intervene.

## Project Description
Have you ever been concerned about how kids act when they get addicted to certain content? 
Content on TVs and Social Media are playing a huge role in introducing kids to the world. Frequently that becomes a problem because of violent and inappropriate scenes and/or situations.
KidErra by SheHacks uses wearable devices to monitor the body's vital signs data (accessed thanks to *Terra*) and detects strange behaviour to inform the parents if necessary. 
This detection is based on a machine learning model that classifies weather someone's given vital signs represent a stressed or a non stressed state.
The parent(s) can access their child's current state through a mobile app. They're also automatically notified in case of a peak in stress levels and a precaution service is launched in the kid's device to temporarly block/blur the content.

The project can be used not only when the kid's consuming content, but also in their day-to-day life if the parents wish to monitor their kids stress rate throughout the day.

She hacks, she cares, she wins.
